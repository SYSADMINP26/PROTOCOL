- [x] Preliminaries:
- [x] LQ:
- [x] 8M sequential lq & env mod doctrine:
- [x] Monitoring phase: Select LQ. Recon env PHYSEC, temp, rad lvl, & GH proximity. If suboptimal, depart.
- [x] Mapping phase: Doc topographical layout. Plan AO sector & purpose.
- [x] Modifying phase: Env decon & psych/phys compromising items rm e.g. bright colors, unnecessary text materiel.
- [x] Marking phase: Boundary & sector demarcation for sector-based op focus/task.
- [x] Making phase: Arrange items by sector. Properly order req equip & materiel est by previous Mapping phase.
- [x] Militarizing phase: Increase PHYSEC, cover, & concealment w/ sandbags, structural support, tunneling, &  munitions.
- [x] Minimizing phase: Reduce forensic trace & resource usage. Destroy traces, decrease sig, & prevent attribution.
- [x] Maintaining phase: Threat preventative cons LQ state. Monitor env state, assess threats, & reduce risks.
- [x] Mitigating phase: Reactive LQ state reset post anomalies/threats. Neutralize previous threats, reduce anomalies.
